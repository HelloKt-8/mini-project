# mini-project
Created with CodeSandbox

A cute side project which I thought was fun, inspired by mewtru from instagram. 
"Do you miss me?" - Unable to click on "No" as it will randomly jump when hovered over and upon clicking "Yes" will take you to another page. 
This was fun! 5/10 for my first mini-project.
